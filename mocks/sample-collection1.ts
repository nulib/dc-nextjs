  description:
    "This collection was from the Slide Library which was once in the Visual Media Center under the Department of Art History at Northwestern University. During its forty-five years of existence, Rosenthal Art Slides was a primary supplier of images to visual resources collections. The company was founded by Julius Rosenthal, a German refugee in Chicago who, in the 1940s, began vending black-and white slides of works of art and architecture to institutions and scholars. ",
